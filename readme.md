Hello World

This is my first project. I will be building a game modeled after guitar hero. 
The objective of the game is to press the ASDF button when the key/note is aligned with the corresponding button. 

Press end to stop the game and reset to restart the current game. 

Score is displayed at top left corner of the game. end of the game. 
If the player attains 80% of the max score they are deemed a winner.
