Hello World

This is my first project. I will be building a game modeled after guitar hero. 

The objective of the game is to press the A button when the falling circle is aligned with the fixed circle down below. Holding the A button will not result in a point. 

Be quick you only have 30 seconds to play. 

Score is displayed at top left corner of the game. The timer is displayed on the top right 
corner of the game. If the player gets more than 20 points in a game a congratulation is in order. 
You can always try again.
